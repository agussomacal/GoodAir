        <ul> Long-term exposure to air pollution contributed to the deaths of more than 8 million people in a year with strokes, heart attacks, lung disease and lung cancer causing many of them, since the 91% of the world population (7 billion persons) lives in areas where air quality is unhealthy, according to the World Health Organization. Almost 94% of those deaths occur in low and middle income countries. Moreover, as stated by Air Quality Life Index of the University of Chicago, people could lose up to 11 years of life expectancy due to living in a big city with polluted air. As claimed by the UNESCO, this problem specially affects the young children.
