# **Deep Good Air Initiative**

### We propose a novel approach using Artificial Intelligence to create smart city designs that exploits the potential of trees to reduce the air pollution and increase the health of people around the globe.

We proposed an automatic system to scan the city landscape and generate a design of trees that reduces de effects of air pollution using Deep Neural Networks with TensorFlow.

* Using satellite images and Convolutional Neural Networks we aim to reconstruct the city landscape.
* Using current models of airflow, pollution levels and our reconstructed landscape we generate a design for planting trees that reduces air pollution.
* Our approach can be trained and customized for any city landscape across the globe providing a flexible, easy to implement and cheap approach to reduce air pollution and increase the health of people.


<!---
* Studies show that ...
* Using tensorflow to train a deep neural network model to predict pollution levels given a tree planting schema over a city.
	* First, transform satelite images in 3d reconstruction space of a city or a land.
	* Second, using data of pollution levels of certain zones train a model to predict the pollution given a tree distribution and a architectural sourounding.
	* Using papers information generate greedy optimal solutions and evaluate pollution levels.
	* Find better solutions.
