# **Deep Good Air Initiative**

### We propose a novel approach to create smart city designs using Artificial Intelligence that exploits the potential of trees to reduce the air pollution and increase the health of people around the globe.


* Studies show that ...
* Using tensorflow to train a deep neural network model to predict pollution levels given a tree planting schema over a city.
	* First, transform satelite images in 3d reconstruction space of a city or a land.
	* Second, using data of pollution levels of certain zones train a model to predict the pollution given a tree distribution and a architectural sourounding.
	* Using papers information generate greedy optimal solutions and evaluate pollution levels.
	* Find better solutions.
