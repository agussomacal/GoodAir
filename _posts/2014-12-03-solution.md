#### The solution.

* Using tensorflow to train a deep neural network model to predict pollution levels given a tree planting schema over a city.
** First, transform satelite images in 3d reconstruction space of a city or a land.
** Second, using data of pollution levels of certain zones train a model to predict the pollution given a tree distribution and a architectural sourounding.
** Using papers information generate greedy optimal solutions and evaluate pollution levels.
** Find better solutions.
